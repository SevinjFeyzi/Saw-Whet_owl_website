              The <strong>Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus)  </strong> are the smallest owls in Eastern North america with the similar quantity as Blue Jay. Saw-whet females are 25% heavier than males which is called <strong>reversed sexual dimorphism. </strong>
                Northern Saw-whet Owls are found mostly in North America, Southeastern and southcentral Alaska, southern Canada, United States and Central mountains of Mexico. According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of these Owls are around two million. Although the species is classified as Least Concern on the Red List, their numbers are decreasing.

        <hr><h3>Northern Saw-whet Owl habitat, nesting, feeding and migration</h3><hr>
        <aside id="aside-1">
          <p>
            Mostly their habitat is evergreen forests, sometimes mixed woods across North America. They choose tree cavities and old nests made by other small raptors. Some of the owls keep their nest through the season, however others migrate south in cold season. 
          </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            This type of owls lay about four to six eggs in tree holes. While female sits on eggs, male hunts and provides with food. Females can have eggs in each breeding season, and it can be different male. Once small baby owls in the nest develope feathers, mother owl leaves them with their father and starts looking for for another male for egg-laying. This type of mating is sequential polyandry. They compete with boreal owls, starlings and squirrels for nest cavities and their nests may be destroyed or the nestlings eaten by those creatures as well as nest predators such as martens and corvids. Saw-whet owls of all ages may be predated by any larger species of hawks or owls, of which there are at least a dozen that overlap in range including Accipiter hawks, which share with the saw-whet owls a preference for wooded habitats with dense thickets or brush.

            <p>
                Up until 1900s, saw-whet owls were thought to be non-migratory species. Nowadays lots of observations show that it is not that rare. Like Boreal owls, Saw-whet females migrate more than males. At the very first leaf drop saw-whet female arranges her migration.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>Northern Saw-whet owls are specialists in feeding on mammals, especially white footed-mice, deer mice and voles.They hunt by scanning like all the birds do, fly down extremely silent to get its prey. Due to recent research, the saw-whets move from perc to perch and scan larger areas to find its prey. Being very active, their hunting period divides  into two main times: before dawn, and around dusk. It can take about 9 kilometers to fly from area to area for hunting purposes. Compared to boreal owls, saw-whets are more aerodynamic because  of their lighter wings.</p>

            To the Hawkmountain.org-s sharing info: 
            "Common name “Saw-whet” refers to the parallel between this owl’s vocalizations and the sound produced when whetting, or sharpening a saw blade. Latin genus name Aegolius comes from Greek for “a bird of ill omen.” The species name acadicus refers to the historical name for the geographical location of the first collected saw-whet owl specimen, in “Acadia.” This includes parts of northeastern North America including Nova Scotia and eastern Québec". <cite><strong>"www.hawkmountain.org *Global Raptor Conservation*</strong></cite>

        As per www.canada.ca: "The brooksi Northern Saw-whet Owl was assessed by COSEWIC as Threatened in 2006 and 2017, and is listed federally in Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act as Threatened. It is protected from hunting, trafficking, or possession in the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site under the Canada National Parks Act. Just over 70% of Haida Gwaii is currently protected from forest harvest, although much of the more productive forest area is not protected. Globally, the subspecies is ranked as Imperilled by NatureServe, with a rank in Canada and British Columbia of Imperilled to Vulnerable. It is on the blue list of species at risk in British Columbia, and individual birds and their nests are protected under the British Columbia Wildlife Act. This subspecies is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), which protects it from international trade." <cite><strong>www.canada.ca *Northern saw-whet Owl subspecies*</strong></cite>

          <dt>1) Northern Saw-whet Owls are one of the smallest owl species in North America.</dt>
           <dt>2) When sensing danger, Northern Saw-whet Owls elongate their body to seem like a tree branch and bring one wing around to the front of their body.</dt>
          <dt>3) They have a distinct white V shape coloration on both the front and back of their head, to confuse predators into ot knowing which way they are looking.<dt>
        <dt>4) They have feathers all the way down to their talons to keep them warm.</dt>
          <dt>5) Migrating Northern Saw-whet Owls can cross the Great Lakes or other large bodies of water. In October of 1999, one landed on a fishing vessel 70 miles from shore in the Atlantic Ocean near Montauk, New York.</dt>
          <dt>6) The oldest Northern Saw-whet Owl on record was at least 9 years, 5 months old when it was captured and released by a Minnesota bird bander in 2007. It was originally banded in Ontario in 1999.</dt>
